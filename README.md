# The Converter

Note: To run this properly, you'll need Visual Studio: Code and a way to run Java. This link (and YouTube videos) helps a lot: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java

It would also help to have a text editor. I use Notepad++, which you can find here: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/
(you could probably just use Notepad, but this is more convenient imo)

Step 1: Download this repot to a place that you can access

Step 2: Go into the java code and replace the dummy file path with the folder's file path

Step 3: Insert all the saveX.dat files that you would want to process

Step 4: Compile/run the java code, and it should generate a text file!
